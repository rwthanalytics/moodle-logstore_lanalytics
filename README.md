# Logstore Learning Analytics for Moodle

This plugin implements a logstore to log data used for analytics purposes. In contrast to [`logstore_standard_log`](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Logging_2#Standard_log_storage_plugin_.28logstore_standard.29) this plugin is designed to respect GDPR.

The plugin is designed to be used in conjunction with `local_learning_analytics`. Please check out the README of that project for more information.
